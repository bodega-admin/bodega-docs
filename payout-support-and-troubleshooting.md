# Payout Support and Troubleshooting

* Send the USDM or ADA to another wallet you control. For example, if you're using Eternl and you don't see it, try Vespr. The USDM or ADA should arrive, but you might not see it on some wallets.&#x20;
* Load up the seed phrase in a different wallet you control. It should display there.&#x20;
* Use the frack it link: [https://unfrack.it/](https://unfrack.it/)
* If none of those work, please message us on Discord for support.&#x20;
