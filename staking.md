# Staking

### Overview of Staking

Staking BODEGA tokens allows you to earn rewards in ADA, the native cryptocurrency of the Cardano blockchain. By staking, you contribute to the protocol's ecosystem and share in the fees collected by the platform.

#### Key Features

* **Staking Period**: Each staking period lasts for 30 days.
* **Snapshots**: A snapshot is taken on the date specified in the **Next Snapshot** field within the staking section of the platform.
* **Rewards Distribution**: Rewards are calculated and distributed based on the snapshot data, which includes the stakes of all users and the total rewards for the period.

### Rewards Calculation and Distribution

#### Reward Pool

Rewards for stakers come from the fees collected by the protocol. These fees are divided into two main portions:

1. **Staking Rewards**: Typically, 50% of the collected fees are allocated for distribution to stakers.
2. **Treasury Allocation**: The remaining 50% is sent to the protocol’s treasury to cover market deployment costs and other operational expenses.

> **Note**: The fee distribution ratio can vary depending on the total amount of fees collected during a period. Adjustments to this ratio are at the discretion of the protocol’s governance.

#### Snapshot Details

The snapshot captures:

* The total amount of BODEGA tokens staked by all participants.
* The total rewards available for the staking period.

This snapshot serves as the basis for calculating each participant’s share of the rewards.

#### Rewards Distribution

* A few days after the snapshot is taken, rewards are distributed to stakers proportionally based on the snapshot data.
* For example, if you staked 10% of the total BODEGA tokens at the time of the snapshot, you would receive 10% of the rewards allocated for that period.

### How to Stake

1. Navigate to the staking section of the platform.
2. Check the **Next Snapshot** field to see the upcoming snapshot date.
3. Stake your BODEGA tokens before the snapshot date to ensure inclusion in the current staking period.
4. Monitor the staking section for updates on rewards distribution after the snapshot.

### Additional Notes

* Staking rewards are distributed in ADA directly to your wallet.
* To maximize your rewards, ensure your tokens remain staked throughout the entire staking period.
* Changes to the fee distribution ratio or staking mechanism will be communicated through official channels.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**1. Can I unstake my tokens at any time?**

* Yes, but unstaking before the snapshot will exclude your tokens from the rewards calculation for that period.

**2. How often are rewards distributed?**

* Rewards are distributed once per staking period, shortly after the snapshot date.

**3. Where can I see my rewards?**

* Rewards will appear in your wallet as ADA once they are distributed.
