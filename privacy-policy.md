## Privacy Policy for Bodega Market on Cardano

**Last Updated: November 26, 2024**

Your privacy is critically important to us. Below, we outline our privacy policy.

### 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how Bodega Labs handles data from users of our website located at [**www.bodegacardano.org**](https://www.bodegacardano.org) and our services.

### 2. Information We Collect

#### a. Wallet Information:

* **Blockchain Data:** When you connect your wallet to use our Services, we collect your Cardano wallet address to process transactions and interact with smart contracts for betting and settlement purposes. This is not traditional personal data but rather public blockchain data.

#### b. Non-Personal Information:

* **Usage Data:** We automatically gather information on how you use our Services, such as which pages you visit, how long you spend on each page, and user interactions with our content.
* **Device Information:** Information about the device you use to access our Services, including device type, operating system, and browser type, might be collected for analytics purposes.

### 3. How We Use Your Information

* **Service Provision:** To facilitate transactions, verify bets, and distribute winnings via smart contracts.
* **Improvement:** To analyze and improve our Services based on usage patterns and feedback.

### 4. Sharing of Information

* **Blockchain Transparency:** Due to the nature of blockchain technology, transactions are public and can be viewed by anyone with access to the Cardano network.
* **Service Providers:** We might share wallet addresses with third-party providers for transaction processing or analytics, but not for any identifiable personal information.
* **Legal Obligations:** We may be required to share information in response to legal requests or to protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property.

### 5. When Visiting the Website

Upon visiting our Websites, our servers will temporarily record each visit in a log file. The information we collect and store until it is automatically deleted includes:

* Your computer's IP address
* Your internet service provider (typically your ISP)
* The date and time of your visit
* The name and URL of the file you access
* The country from which you access the Websites
* Your computer's operating system and details about your browser (like the provider, version, and language)
* The protocol used for the transmission (for example, HTTP/1.1)
* The page and website address from which you were linked to our Websites, along with any search terms used if applicable

### 6. Data Security

No personal information beyond your wallet address is collected, which inherently provides a level of anonymity. However, blockchain transactions are transparent by design, and while we implement security measures to protect our platform, the nature of blockchain means that wallet addresses and transactions are publicly viewable.

### 7. Your Rights

Given the limited personal data we collect, traditional privacy rights like access, correction, and deletion are not directly applicable. However, you can always disconnect your wallet from our Services.

### 8. Data Retention

We do not retain any personal information beyond what is necessary for transaction processing and record-keeping as per blockchain records.

### 9. Cookies

We might use cookies to understand user behavior on our platform. You can manage or disable cookies through your browser settings, but this might affect your experience on our site.

### 10. Third-Party Links

Our Services might link to external sites, but we are not responsible for their privacy practices. Always review the privacy policy of any third-party site before proceeding.

### 11. Children's Privacy

Our Services are not directed at individuals under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly collect any information from or about children.

### 12. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We might update this Privacy Policy. We will inform you of any changes by revising the date at the top of this policy.
