# Mainnet V1 Security Assumptions

Please read this before interacting with our mainnet protocol. Users should have access to full information and understand the security assumptions associated with using this V1 mainnet.

This V1 mainnet is unaudited. As with any smart contracts, interact with them at your own risk. We've taken multiple security measures to ensure utmost security that we could given the time we had to deliver this first version, however everyone should be aware of risks involved with using the protocol.

Our V1 version is purposely centralized to mitigate the possibility of smart contracts risks, and this gives us more assurance in this V1 mainnet, which is only intended to allow the community to bet on the outcome of the 2024 Presidential Election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.&#x20;
