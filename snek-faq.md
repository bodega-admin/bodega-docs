# SNEK FAQ

* This bet is in ADA instead of USDM. This allows users to participate in the bet while also still having exposure to ADA.&#x20;
* The bet will be resolved on December 1st if SNEK doesn't reach all time high, but it can be resolved sooner and ready for payouts, if it reaches all time high before December 1st.
* All bets are final, you can't cancel or remove bets.
* The final payout depends on the final bets, which is scheduled to be around November 11th at 9:00 AM EST. This means your payout isn't necessarily what is displayed in the UI at the given time of the bet. After the final bet is placed, the finalized payout will also be displayed.
* There is 48 hours to place the bet, and the UI displays a countdown timer showing this information.
* Target price of SNEK must surpass 0.0041 ADA, and will be based on the prices on both Minswap and SundaeSwap.
