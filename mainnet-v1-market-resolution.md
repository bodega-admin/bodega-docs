# Mainnet V1 Market Resolution

**2024 Presidential Election**

The outcome of the 2024 Presidential Election between Trump and Harris will be determined under the same parameters as PolyMarket. \
\
It may be a few weeks until there is a clear consensus for the winner of the election.\
\
The market will resolve when Associated Press, Fox News, and NBC News all call the race for the same candidate.

In the unlikely event there is no consensus by January 20, 2025 (inauguration day), the market will resolve based on who is inaugurated. \

**SNEK Price Prediction**

This bet is in ADA instead of USDM. This allows users to participate in the bet while also still having exposure to ADA.&#x20;

The bet will be resolved on December 1st if SNEK doesn't reach all time high, but it can be resolved sooner and ready for payouts, if it reaches all time high before December 1st.

All bets are final, you can't cancel or remove bets.

The final payout depends on the final bets, which is scheduled to be around November 11th at 9:00 AM EST. This means your payout isn't necessarily what is displayed in the UI at the given time of the bet. After the final bet is placed, the finalized payout will also be displayed.

There is 48 hours to place the bet, and the UI displays a countdown timer showing this information.

Target price of SNEK must surpass 0.0041 ADA, and will be based on the prices on both Minswap and SundaeSwap.

**Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul**

This bet is in ADA, similar to the SNEK bet. The betting window is open for approximately 4 days.&#x20;

This bet should be resolved by November 16th.&#x20;

**In the event of a tie,** the tiebreaker will first go to the person who was chosen to win the first round of the fight, based on a majority decision from the judges. In the event the first round is also deemed a tie, the next tiebreaker will be whoever landed the most total punches. If this is also a tie, then this pattern will continue into following rounds.&#x20;
