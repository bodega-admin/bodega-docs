# Mainnet V1 Market Resolution

The outcome of the 2024 Presidential Election between Trump and Harris will be determined under the same parameters as PolyMarket. \
\
It may be a few weeks until there is a clear consensus for the winner of the election.\
\
The market will resolve when Associated Press, Fox News, and NBC News all call the race for the same candidate.

In the unlikely event there is no consensus by January 20, 2025 (inauguration day), the market will resolve based on who is inaugurated. \
